## Current state: refresh of 2026-10-25 (installed commit 46d55cb)

**Start here for what's installed and pending now:** [`refresh-2026-10-25/README.md`](refresh-2026-10-25/README.md).
It's a full asset list with descriptions, appearance evidence, function versus proposed use, collection tags, source paths, IDs, creators and credits, dimensions, counts of parts, scripts and effects, the model hierarchy, dependencies, script metadata, limitations and SHA-256 checksums. Checksums and counts were verified on archive.

| Group | Count |
|---|---|
| Installed catalog templates | 38 (zero embedded scripts) |
| Tracked unregistered candidates | 13 (3 earlier prepared + 2 new walls + 8 new imports) |
| Live rooms | 6 |
| Nested/copy Model records | 5,758 (**not** unique marketplace assets) |
| Distinct content references | 500 |
| Script containers | 59 |

The refresh's installed and pending sections are current. The files below are earlier snapshots, kept unchanged as history; where their status claims differ, the refresh wins.

## Files (historical snapshots)

Read them in this order:

| [`Studio_Asset_Guide_2026-10-25.json`](Studio_Asset_Guide_2026-10-25.json) | Human-oriented guide. `assets` (39 stored top-level entries: 34 previous + 5 `BuilderAssetReview` candidates), `rooms` (6), `commonPreparation`. Each entry has appearance, function, evidence, proposed collections and known provenance. | 53 KB |
| [`Studio_Asset_Inventory_2026-10-25.json`](Studio_Asset_Inventory_2026-10-25.json) | Exhaustive index. `ModelRecords` (2594 **nested** models, not distinct products), `LooseParts` (4), `ContentReferences` (448 distinct content URLs/IDs with use paths), `ScriptRecords` (13), `Services`. | 2.3 MB |
| [`Catalog_Expansion_2026-10-25.json`](Catalog_Expansion_2026-10-25.json) | The catalog expansion manifest: 24 templates prepared in `ServerStorage.StudioBuilderExpansion`, each with id, displayName, collections, sourceRef, an optional `sourceAssetId` (provenance only, never loaded), scripts (0), parts, size and functionality (decorative only). Original provenance, kept unchanged: its `status` and `templatePath` describe the pre-install state. The items were later installed into `StudioBuilderTemplates` and checked in Play (see [`../integration-catalog-expansion.md`](../integration-catalog-expansion.md)). | 16 KB |

They're adapted free assets and material variants of the modular kit (source 12219944662), plus the tracked White Brick Wall (12782716872) resized to the grid, not independent models. Install source: `preparedPath`. **Registered in `Catalog.luau`; Studio install pending.** The wide doorway's opening is 8 × 9 above a 1-stud threshold; avatar walkthrough not tested. | 5 KB |

## Structure and decor candidates (2026-10-25)

**Registered, structure pieces (installed in Studio at 24e8047; visual QA pending):** `structure_wall_01`, `structure_window_wall_01`, `structure_doorway_01`, `structure_floor_01`, `structure_ceiling_01`, with structure kinds wall, window_wall, doorway, floor and ceiling.
**Registered, decor (catalog only; Studio install pending):** `retro_record_player_01` (with the creator's requested credit "RushioLCO (credit requested)" kept verbatim in the catalog's `credit` field) and `retro_radio_01` (creator zzz_1551). Both are decorative, with no audio.
**Deferred, not registered:** `structure_corner_01`, `structure_industrial_window_01`, `cozy_shoji_divider_01`.
The structure plan is [`../structure-placement-plan.md`](../structure-placement-plan.md).
The 10 templates have zero scripts and zero unanchored parts, and 319 parts in total.

| ID | Name | Category | Size (studs) | Parts | Source asset | Creator / credit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `structure_wall_01` | Plaster Wall | wall | 16 × 15 × 1 | 1 | 12219944662 | plexaruszx |
| `structure_window_wall_01` | Window Wall | wall | 16 × 15 × 1 | 7 | 12219944662 | plexaruszx |
| `structure_doorway_01` | Open Doorway Wall | doorway | 16 × 15 × 1 | 5 | 12219944662 | plexaruszx |
| `structure_corner_01` | Plaster Corner | wall | 16 × 15 × 16 | 2 | 12219944662 | plexaruszx |
| `structure_floor_01` | Wood Floor Tile | floor | 16 × 1 × 16 | 2 | 12219944662 | plexaruszx |
| `structure_ceiling_01` | Plain Ceiling Tile | ceiling | 16 × 1 × 16 | 2 | 12219944662 (the floor geometry) | plexaruszx |
| `structure_industrial_window_01` | Industrial Window Frame | window | 5.2 × 7.13 × 1.39 | 1 | 13304797063 | 2BeeSupreme |
| `retro_record_player_01` | Vintage Record Player | decor | 2.1 × 2.35 × 1.94 | 26 | 12769863525 | **RushioLCO (credit requested; keep it)** |
| `retro_radio_01` | Vintage Radio | decor | 1.55 × 1.28 × 1.04 | 1 | 14003553892 | zzz_1551 |
| `cozy_shoji_divider_01` | Shoji Room Divider | divider | 1.71 × 6.17 × 4.46 | **272** | 10862992379 | Sjenchi |

- **The ceiling is not a separate marketplace model.** `structure_ceiling_01` is a neutral recolour of the kit's floor geometry, from the same source (`Modular Room.Model.Floor`, asset 12219944662, plexaruszx).
- **Modifications by Codex:**
  - removed kit floor sections from the standalone walls, and removed helper parts, imported interactions and the door leaf;
  - aligned the straight walls to local X, with centred bottom pivots;
  - scaled the divider uniformly to 42%.
- **Inspection:** zero seam gap at a 16-stud wall pitch; the doorway is clear 4 studs at its centre. Runtime placement isn't tested.
- **Source asset IDs and creator URLs are provenance only.** They're never loaded, and they never go into `Catalog.luau`.

**Rejected entirely.** These imports were removed for unsafe embedded code. Keep the IDs here so they aren't re-imported:

| Asset ID | Name | Scripts | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 107809369531099 | Rooms Kit Walls Floors Doors Interior | 43 | Unrelated or obfuscated embedded code; the entire imported candidate was removed |
| 72345259689081 | Acoustic Foam Tile Wall Studio Concrete Panel Back | 2 | A hidden, unrelated runtime and UI controller, despite a no-script description; the entire imported candidate was removed |

**Deferred (not prepared):**

| Asset ID | Name | Creator | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 120565443892509 | Modular Wall Pack | WilliamBosso | Needs orientation and fit review before preparation |
| 87617727134882 | Modular Wall Trim Pack (FIXED) | KoBoIce | Needs orientation and fit review before preparation |
| 15777685204 | Old Wood Flooring | FroztedFrozty | A MaterialVariant, not a standalone floor model |

## Reading rules

- **Collections are proposed.** Starter, Cozy, Retro, 1980s, Winter, Futuristic, Executive and Broadcast are suggestions. Everything is free, and no entitlement or purchase logic exists.
- **Unknown sources stay unknown.** Don't invent model IDs. Mesh or content IDs aren't model IDs.
- **Archived originals differ from the fixed live versions** (for example the cups, the lounge blanket and the creator desk microphone). Check the live room before treating a staged template as current.
- **Counts include nested descendants.** Don't add up part or instance counts across records. They aren't triangle, GPU or performance measurements.
- **Appearance doesn't mean function.** Microphones, speakers, laptops and mixers don't implement audio. Decorative chairs aren't podcast seats. The functional seats are `Workspace.PodcastStudio.Seats.Seat1`–`Seat4`.
- The six existing rooms are listed for reference only and must stay untouched by the builder.

## Querying the large JSON

Query it locally instead of opening the whole file. For example:

```sh
# Top-level keys and counts
python3 -c "import json;d=json.load(open('docs/assets/Studio_Asset_Inventory_2026-10-25.json'));print({k:(len(v) if isinstance(v,list) else v) for k,v in d.items()})"

# Names, paths and proposed collections of the guide entries
python3 -c "import json;[print(a.get('name'),'|',a.get('path'),'|',a.get('proposedCollections')) for a in json.load(open('docs/assets/Studio_Asset_Guide_2026-10-25.json'))['assets']]"
```

Field names inside records can change between snapshots. Inspect one record (`d['ModelRecords'][0]`) before you write a query.

## Refreshing the snapshot

1. Codex re-runs the Studio scan on place `132242140555698` and exports the same four files with a new date suffix.
2. Add the new files beside the old ones under `docs/assets/`. Don't overwrite earlier snapshots, so diffs stay possible.
3. Update this README: the snapshot table, the file table (names and counts) and any changed reading rules.
4. Check the counts locally with the commands above against the counts the handoff text claims, before you commit.
5. Commit on a working branch. Never commit place files or binary models, and never merge to `main` as part of a refresh.
